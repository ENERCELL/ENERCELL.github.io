## ElectroNic ExeRcises for CiphEricaL Learning

This is the home of the ENERCELL project, which is devoted to developing simplified versions 
of post-quantum (a.k.a. quantum-safe) cryptographic algorithms suitable for classroom use.  (In the spirit of S-DES, S-AES, 
Demitasse, and JHA.)

Currently available:
- [Alkaline](alkaline), a simplified version of Kyber (Alkaline is suitable for powering very weak light-sabers.)
	- Smeagol, a.k.a. Alkaline-LA, a version which requires only Linear Algebra (similar to Frodo)
	- Phantom, a.k.a. Alkaline-ALG, a version which requires only Abstract Algebra (similar to NewHope)

- [Lithium](lithium) (in development), a simplified version of Dilithium (Lithium is suitable for powering 
[very small starships](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_races_and_species_in_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#G'Gugvuntts_and_Vl'hurgs).)
