## ElectroNic ExeRcises for CiphEricaL Learning

This is the home of the ENERCELL project, which is devoted to developing simplified versions 
of post-quantum (a.k.a. quantum-safe) cryptographic algorithms suitable for classroom use.  (In the spirit of S-DES, S-AES, 
Demitasse, and JHA.)

Currently available:
- Alkaline, a simplified version of Kyber (Alkaline is suitable for powering very weak light-sabers.)
	- Smeagol, a.k.a. Alkaline-LA, a version which requires only Linear Algebra (similar to Frodo)
	- Phantom, a.k.a. Alkaline-ALG, a version which requires only Abstract Algebra (similar to NewHope)

- Lithium (in development), a simplified version of Dilithium (Lithium is suitable for powering very small starships.)
